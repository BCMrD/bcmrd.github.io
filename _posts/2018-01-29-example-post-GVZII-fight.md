A while back my wife and some friends wanted to adapt the stage play Geeks vs. Zombies for younger actors/audience.  Of the many fight sequences, all of which were set to music, the [trash can fight](https://youtu.be/YRe6nkFolbY?t=1h15m4s) was one of the most fun.

Since our production company did not have the rights to use [Muse’s Uprising](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/uprising/991509751?i=991509754) used in the original production I was asked to come up with something that had the same feel.

Using two synths, Layered Kick Bass and Ambient Modwheel Morpher along with a drummer track I was able to write music that came close to replicating the swinging feel of the original.

Varying the intensity of the Swing parameter between contrasting drummer regions, I could match the feel of the swing in the Bass track.

For the climax of the fight, I switched the drummer track to open up the cymbals.

Beyond a similar feel the song needed to have a pause near the end to parallel the onstage action where the geeks check to see if the zombie is dead.

An interesting thing about the pause.  When using the arpeggiator plugin you must turn it off or it will keep arpeggiating the last chord played.  I used track based automation to turn the arpeggiator on and off.

I moved the Song End Marker closer the end of the piece to prevent a bunch of dear air at the end of my bounce.  It also helps with keeping track of the play head.

Here’s the end result: [Trash Can Fight - Geeks vs. Zombies Youth Edition](/audio/GVSYouthEd-TrashCanFight.m4a)
