### Inline Video Test

Just a way for us to keep track of what we’ve listened to in class.  If any of you are considering doing the “album review” for extra credit please consider selecting a track or two off this playlist. Ideally, you would review tracks that you did not suggest.  Keep your review focused to no more than three (3) tracks.


The artists we’ve listened to so far by class day...
