### Running Class Playlist

Just a way for us to keep track of what we’ve listened to in class.  If any of you are considering doing the “album review” for extra credit please consider selecting a track or two off this playlist. Ideally, you would review tracks that you did not suggest.  Keep your review focused to no more than three (3) tracks.
