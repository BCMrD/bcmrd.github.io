# Welcome!

# Mr. D's GitHub Pages for B30

### Customizing your GitHub Pages site coming soon!

### Customizing Jekyll Themes

For lesson one we will just update our README markdown to include our Lesson 1 portfolio assignment.

In the near future we will beging customizing our site using the Jekyll site framework to add more pages and generate our portfolio blog.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BCMrD/bcmrd.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

In the meantime check out the directory structure of my site to give you an idea of what's coming. Feel freet to create an audio directory for your project audio files.

### Good luck!!
