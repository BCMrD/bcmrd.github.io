# Welcome!

### Mr. D's GitHub Pages for B30

### Markdown

It might be handy to build a Portfolio Grading Rubric checklist right into your page.  Yes, Markdown can do checklists!!


```checklist markdown

[ ] Create and upload five (5) screenshots.
[ ] Bounce Logic project and upload to audio folder.
[ ] Write at least 250 words on your experience with the lesson.
[ ] Audio plays back through external speakers.
[ ] Screenshots render correctly.
[ ] Text is legible.
[ ] Demonstrate one tip for class.

```
Feel free to copy the markdown above and modify as you see fit.

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Customizing Jekyll Themes

For lesson one we will just update our README markdown to include our Lesson 1 portfolio assignment.

In the near future we will beging customizing our site using teh Jekyll site framework to add more pages and generate our portfolio blog.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BCMrD/bcmrd.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Good luck!!
