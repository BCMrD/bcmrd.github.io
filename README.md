#### Example Portfolio Assignment 1:
##### Geeks vs. Zombies Youth Edition

![Overview Screendhot](/images/L1Overview.png)

A while back my wife and some friends wanted to adapt the stage play Geeks vs. Zombies for younger actors/audience.  Of the many fight sequences, all of which were set to music, the [trash can fight](https://youtu.be/YRe6nkFolbY?t=1h15m4s) was one of the most fun.

Since our production company did not have the rights to use [Museâ€™s Uprising](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/uprising/991509751?i=991509754)used in the original production I was asked to come up with something that had the same feel.

Using two synths, Layered Kick Bass and Ambient Modwheel Morpher along with a drummer track I was able to write music that came close to replicating the swinging feel of the original.

Using varying the intensity of the Swing parameter between contrasting drummer regions, I could match the feel of the swing in the Bass track.

For the climax of the fight, I switched the drummer track to open up the cymbals.

Beyond a similar feel the song needed to have a pause near the end to parallel the onstage action where the geeks check to see if the zombie is dead.

 ![ARP Automation](/images/L1ArpStop.png)

An interesting thing about the pause.  When using the arpeggiator plugin you must turn it off or it will keep arpeggiating the last chord played.  I used track based automation to turn the arpeggiator on and off.

 ![Song End Marker](/images/L1SongEnd2.png)

I moved the Song End Marker closer the end of the piece to prevent a bunch of dear air at the end of my bounce.  It also helps with keeping track of the play head.


### Markdown

It might be handy to build a Portfolio Grading Rubric checklist right into your page.  Yes, Markdown can do checklists!!


```markdown

- [x] Create and upload five (5) screenshots.
- [ ] Bounce Logic project and upload to audio folder.
- [x] Write at least 250 words on your experience with the lesson.
- [ ] Audio plays back through external speakers.
- [x] Screenshots render correctly.
- [x] Text is legible.
- [ ] Demonstrate one tip for class.

```
The above mark down will render like this...

- [x] Create and upload five (5) screenshots.
- [ ] Bounce Logic project and upload to audio folder.
- [x] Write at least 250 words on your experience with the lesson.
- [ ] Audio plays back through external speakers.
- [x] Screenshots render correctly.
- [x] Text is legible.
- [ ] Demonstrate one tip for class.

Feel free to copy the markdown above and modify as you see fit.

### Customizing Jekyll Themes

For lesson one we will just update our README markdown to include our Lesson 1 portfolio assignment.

In the near future we will beging customizing our site using the Jekyll site framework to add more pages and generate our portfolio blog.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BCMrD/bcmrd.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

In the meantime check out the directory structure of my site to give you an idea of what's coming. Feel freet to create an audio directory for your project audio files.

### Good luck!!
