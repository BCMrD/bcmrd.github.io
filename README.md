### Running Class Playlist

Just a way for us to keep track of what we’ve listened to in class.  If any of you are considering doing the "album review" for extra credit please consider selecting a track or two off this playlist. Ideally, you would review tracks that you did not suggest.  Keep your review focused to no more than three (3) tracks.

### Customizing Jekyll Themes

For lesson one we will just update our README markdown to include our Lesson 1 portfolio assignment.

In the near future we will customize our site using the Jekyll site framework to add more pages and generate our portfolio blog.

Your Github Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BCMrD/bcmrd.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

In the meantime check out the directory structure of my site to give you an idea of what's coming. Feel free to create an audio directory for your project audio files.

### Good luck!!
